Let's use the following contribution guideline:
1. Create a new branch for your work only. If you want, for simplicty name it with your name or alias.
2. Before you start to work on your branch, get the latest version of the master branch with `git pull` and `git rebase origin/master`. Resolve conflict if any.
3. Do you work, commit, commit... and push your changes to your branch with `git push`
4. When you are ready to merge, rebase your branch and resolve conflict with `git pull` and `git rebase origin/master`.
5. You are ready to go, you can then do your pull request to the Master branch
